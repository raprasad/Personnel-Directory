The motor derives its energy from protons driven into the cell by chemical gradients or electrical fields. The direction of the motor rotation depends in part on signals generated by sensory systems, of which the best studied analyzes chemical stimuli. Our research group is trying to learn how the motor works, the nature of the signal that controls the motor's direction of rotation, and how this signal is processed by the chemical sensory system. These questions are being approached by a variety of molecular-genetic and physical techniques. The goal is an understanding of chemiosmotic coupling and sensory transduction at the molecular level.</p>",

This is the broad question our laboratory seeks to understand. In bacteria alone, this process is involved in the transfer of antibiotic resistance, spore formation, and proper chromosome segregation during growth. Yet, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of DNA translocation across membranes in any system, as tools to study the mechanism of DNA transporters in their biological context at the membrane have been lacking. We combine in vitro and in vivo biochemistry, microscopy, microbiology and molecular biology to study these DNA transport complexes.</p>\r\n<p><b> DNA transport during sporulation</b></p>\r\n   \r\n<p>Proper chromosome segregation is essential for successful cell division in all organisms.  Interestingly, bacterial cells often form a division septum prior to completion of DNA segregation. Sporulating Bacillus subtilis cells provide an extreme example of this phenomenon in that they must transport more than 3 Megabases of a chromosome across a division septum and into the small cellular compartment that will become the spore.  SpoIIIE, a member of a large family of bacterial and archeal membrane-bound ATPases (FtsK/SpoIIIE), is required for active transport of the chromosomal DNA at the division septum during sporulation.  Using quantitative fluorescence microscopy, and in vivo DNA transport assays to study the oligomeric state and transport properties of the SpoIIIE complex led to the very surprising and novel result that the DNA is transported across two membranes during sporulation.  These data predict a new model for DNA transport in which the transmembrane segments of the transporter form linked DNA-conducting channels across the two lipid bilayers of the septum. This system provides a unique opportunity to tackle this interesting phenomenon using complimentary in vivo and in vitro approaches and to address  issues which have significant implications for our understanding of how cells efficiently move of large nucleic acids across membranes.</p>",

            "research_description": "<p>Retroviruses are associated with a wide range of clinical diseases, including leukemia, tumors, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an exceptionally deadly retrovirus that has caused more than 20 million deaths over the past two decades. Due to the emergence of resistant strains, it is unlikely that current drug strategies, which target individual proteins, will lead to a cure. There is a serious need for superior approaches: for example, targeting anti-viral drugs towards essential RNA-protein or protein-protein interactions. To this end, I am interested in studying the structural determinants of reverse transcription and gene translation in retroviruses like HIV, Human T-cell leukemia virus and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MLV). Although aspects of reverse transcription and gene translation have received considerable attention, understanding of RNA structures and events that promote or regulate these steps remain primitive.</p>\r\n        <p>Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other biophysical and biochemical methods are the principal tools used in my laboratory to study these relatively large RNA and protein molecules. The structure determination of large protein- RNA complexes by NMR is extremely challenging, but the potential payoff is high and should ultimately lead to detailed models of steps involved in retroviral replication. The following are some of the projects that are currently being studied in my lab:</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Primer placement and initiation of reverse transcription </strong></p>\r\n        <p>For successful retroviral infection to occur, the RNA genome must be reverse-transcribed into DNA by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. The primer needed for the first synthetic step of reverse transcription is a specific tRNA molecule from the host that is packaged into the virion during assembly. This tRNA is annealed to the 5&rsquo; end of the viral genome called the Primer Binding Site (PBS), and requires the presence of a viral nucleocapsid protein (NC) to facilitate the necessary nucleic acid rearrangements. Studies in my laboratory are intended to provide the structural details of these tRNA-PBS-NC complexes and elucidate mechanisms that promote the initiation of reverse transcription.</p>\r\n        <p><strong>Readthrough translation:</strong></p>\r\n        <p>In retroviruses, the structural Gag protein and the enzymatic Pol proteins are generated from the same precursor mRNA either by a frameshift or a readthrough mechanism. For example, MLV uses the readthorugh strategy and has the two genes separated by a single UAG stop codon. About nintey-five percent of the translating ribosomes recognize this codon and end the Gag protein. The other five percent, however, insert a glutamine residue at this position before resuming downstream translation into the pol gene. This 20:1 ratio of Gag to Gag-Pol is known to be vital for viral infectivity. Interestingly, the Gag stop codon is immediately followed by a sequence of RNA predicted to form a pseudoknot. Studies have shown this sequence to be critical for the readthrough function. </p>\r\n        <p>In collaboration with Dr. Stephen Goff&rsquo;s lab at Columbia University, my goal is to elucidate the solution structure and the mechanisms by which this pseudoknot functions to maintain the Gag/Gag-Pol ratio.</p>",

At the same time, however, this has created a bottleneck at the level of going from parts lists to functional and mechanistic insights. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the study of membrane-associated processes. This area of cell biology has been particularly difficult to dissect by classical biochemistry but now stands poised to benefit from targeted and systematic biochemical reconstitution strategies that make use of the identified components. My lab is interested in bridging this post-genomic gap as it pertains to the study of very long-chain fatty acids, insertion of tail-anchored proteins into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and autophagy.",

            "research_description": "<p>Our group is using molecular, genetic and electrophysiological techniques to explore the molecular and neuronal basis of innate social behaviors in the mouse. Two major lines of research are currently being pursued in the laboratory: </p>\r\n        <p>We are pursuing several projects at the molecular, cellular and systems levels in order to investigate the architecture and functional logic of neuronal circuits underlying pheromone signaling. The key questions we are addressing are: What is the nature of the mammalian pheromones and of the receptors that detect them? How are pheromone signals processed in the brain in order to generate species- and sex-specific behaviors such as aggression, mating, parental behavior, defensive behavior? What are the basic developmental processes that ensure appropriate neuronal connections between the olfactory sensory neurons and the brain? What are the respective roles of sensory experience and genetic information in setting appropriate pheromone-induced behaviors, and how are circuits underlying sex-specific behaviors established in the male and female brains?</p>\r\n        <p>The second set of projects explores the phenomenon of genomic imprinting in the brain, and the role of this mode of epigenetic modification in brain development and adult brain function. Genomic imprinting results in preferential expression of the paternally, or the maternally inherited allele of certain genes. We have recently used a genome-wide approach to characterize the repertoire of imprinted genes in the mouse embryonic and adult CNS. Our study uncovered over 1000 new loci with imprinted features, suggesting that imprinting is a major mode of epigenetic regulation in the brain. Imprinting appears to preferentially affect neural systems associated with social, motivational and homeostatic brain functions. Comparison of the imprinted gene repertoire in the adult hypothalamus and cortex, and in the developing brain demonstrates a complex spatiotemporal, species-, sex- and isoform-specific regulation. Genomic imprinting thus emerges as a major and dynamic mode of epigenetic regulation of brain function, with direct implications for the understanding of evolution and diseases. Future projects in the lab will aim at better understanding this mode of epigenetic regulation in mechanistic and functional terms.</p>",

This small and translucent vertebrate exhibits a series of visually induced behaviors which can be analyzed quantitatively down to the individual motor components. Using behavioral assays in combination with various calcium indicators and two-photon microscopy we monitor neuronal activity throughout the fish brain in an awake and intact preparation. An extended goal of our research is the study of how changes or variations in the behavior are reflected in changes in the underlying neuronal activity. To that end, we have developed several quantitative learning assays and tools for in vivo monitoring \u2013 and controlling - of neural activity in freely swimming larvae.\r\n </p>",

Recently we have focused on the functions and regulation of polo-like kinases (Plk) in mammalian cells. Three mammalian Plks have been identified; Plk1 is expressed during M phase and cytokinesis, whereas Plk2 (Snk) and Plk3 (Fnk) are expressed in other phases of the cell cycle. These enzymes are characterized by their similar N-terminal catalytic domains, as well as a C-terminal domain with highly conserved sequences termed the polo box. We have previously demonstrated that the polo box directs Plk1 to specific cellular locations and is required together with protein kinase activity to promote cell proliferation. Plk1 localizes to centrosomes and the spindle poles at metaphase, in the central spindle during anaphase, and at the midbody during cytokinesis. Plk1 has been implicated in centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation and activation of the anaphase-promoting complex.</p>\r\n        <p>We have determined that intramolecular interactions of the catalytic and non-catalytic domains, as well as phosphorylation of Plk1 regulate the activation of its protein kinase activity. Our use of small interfering RNA to deplete Plk1 in cells demonstrates that it is required for centrosome duplication, anaphase and cytokinesis in mammalian cells. Cancer cells depleted of Plk1 rapidly undergo apoptosis. We are investigating whether this occurs in a wide variety of tumor cells or normal cells, as Plk1 may be a useful chemotherapy target.</p>\r\n        <p>A major effort in our laboratory is directed at identification and characterization of Plk1 substrates. Mitotic motor proteins, including the mitotic kinesin-like protein (MKLP1/CHO1), are of special interest. We also study the changes in function of substrates after mutation of sites phosphorylated by Plk1.</p>",

Yet, signals that direct differentiation can be transient so that other mechanisms, such as those encoded by the Polycomb Group (PcG) and trithorax Group (trxG) genes, are used to maintain the gene expression patterns that encode cellular identities. These epigenetic mechanisms are thought to involve changes in chromatin structure that fix gene expression patterns in a manner that is inherited through cell division.&nbsp; This allows the expression pattern of a gene to reflect the ancestry of the cell it resides in.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, during the first few hours of development in <i>Drosophila</i>, precise patterns of HOX gene expression along the anterior-posterior axis are established by the actions of the Gap and pair-rule genes.&nbsp; This pattern of expression encodes the identity of body segments; thus if HOX genes are inappropriately expressed in more anterior segments, those segments form posterior instead of anterior structures.&nbsp; This can happen either because the correct HOX gene expression pattern is not established initially, or because the pattern is not maintained.&nbsp; The maintenance of HOX gene repression requires the PcG, while maintenance of active transcription requires the trxG. In mammals PcG genes are also important for neural and hematopoietic development and stem cell self-renewal, and they are misregulated in several cancers.</p>\r\n        <p>PcG proteins function in large complexes that modify chromatin structure and repress transcription.&nbsp; Two PcG complexes have been characterized, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1), and ESC-E(Z).&nbsp; They have distinct biochemical activities towards chromatin and collaborate to maintain gene repression.&nbsp; PRC1 alters chromatin structure in a manner that inhibits both ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling and transcription.&nbsp; ESC-E(Z) methylates histone H3 on lysine 27, perhaps providing a stable mark for PcG repressed chromatin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n        <p>Characterization of PcG complexes has begun to uncover how PcG proteins might use chromatin structure to block transcription, but does not provide an explanation for how these PcG dependent chromatin structures are inherited in each cell cycle. Both DNA replication and mitosis involve changes in chromatin structure, which might interfere with PcG protein actions.&nbsp; It therefore seems likely that there are specific mechanisms operating as chromatin progresses through the cell cycle to ensure that PcG-mediated repression is maintained.&nbsp; Indeed, regulation of single genes involves more than 15 PcG gene products, some of which might be specifically involved in inheritance.&nbsp; Our goal is to reconstitute steps in epigenetic inheritance<i> in vitro</i> to dissect the biochemical mechanisms involved.&nbsp; Replication of chromatin in the presence or absence of PcG proteins is carried out in cell free systems, and the effect of DNA replication on PcG activities determined.&nbsp; We aim to determine requirements for duplication of PcG dependent chromatin structures, and whether inheritance is mechanistically separable from transcriptional repression.</p>\r\n        <p>A second project in the lab is the characterization of chromatin structure alterations induced by one PcG complex, PRC1.&nbsp; Data obtained using a four-protein recombinant core of this complex suggests that each PcG complex clusters 3-4 nucleosomes, leading to compaction of nucleosomal arrays.&nbsp; One way this could occur is if the complex has multiple nucleosome binding sites; we will test this idea and identify the nucleosome binding site(s) in the complex.&nbsp; The clustering of nucleosomes by PcG complexes might represent a novel way of folding chromatin, which will be determined by comparing the orientation of nucleosomes in PcG-compacted chromatin to those in chromatin compacted by histone H1.</p>",

We are particularly interested in determining the molecular mechanism of temperature sensing. We therefore focus on the temperature-sensing TRP channels such as TRPV1, TRPV2, and TRPM8.    Several temperature-sensing TRP channels like TRPV1, TRPV2 and TRPA1 are expressed in nociceptor neurons, and therefore responsible for pain sensations in response to noxious stimuli.   The biophysical and biochemical mechanisms of pain and heat sensing are not only of academic interest, but also of medical and pharmacological interest. With structures of these TRP channels, we will be better equipped to design chemical inhibitors, which could potentially be used therapeutically. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Structural studies of TAP, the ABC transporter associated with antigen processing </strong></p>\r\n<p>The goal is to elucidate how TAP, a heterodimer of two membrane-spanning proteins, TAP1 and TAP2, transports peptides generated by the proteasome in the cytosol into the endoplasmic reticulum for loading onto MHC class I molecules. Loaded class I molecules then travel to the cell surface and present the peptides to T cells, an immune system mechanism to recognize and eliminate deregulated or tumorigenic cells, virally-infected cells and foreign cells (e.g. graft rejection).  We have undertaken structural studies of the cytosolic C-terminal nucleotide bingin domains (NBDs) of TAP1 and TAP2 to understand how ATP binding and hydrolysis fuels peptide transport.  Furthermore, we have overexpressed the full-length TAP ABC transporter at levels adequate for biochemical and crystallographic studies.

Nramp1 transports metals across the phagolysosomal membrane of macrophages and other phagocytic cells, and is important for the antimicrobial function of these cells.  DMT1 (divalent metal transporter 1, also known as Nramp2 or DCT1) is responsible for absorption of dietary iron and manganese in the proximal duodenum.  Furthermore, DMT1 allows assimilation of transferrin-bound iron by the red blood cell precursors in specialized endosomal compartments.  The goal is to determine the molecular mechanism of metal-ion transport by the Nramp family of proteins through structural studies of a bacterial Nramp protein, MntH.</p>",

In other words, how does an organism go from a single cell (the newly fertilized egg) to a complex multicellular structure with an enormous diversity of cell types, with each cell deployed in the proper spatial position for its particular physiological role? Further, how does the developmental program that exists in the egg lead to the reliable production of specific pattern elements, such as hands with a very specific set of five fingers in humans?</p>\r\n        <p>One important aspect of patterning is the ability of cells within a given tissue primordium to communicate their geographic position and their developmental state to neighboring cells. Our particular focus is on studying an important pathway for such cell-cell signaling using the fruit fly (<i>Drosophila melanogaster</i>) because of the powerful combination of genetic, developmental and molecular tools available in this system.</p>\r\n        <p>This signaling system involves the protein product of the decapentaplegic (dpp) gene which we discovered about 15 years ago. The dpp protein is a member of the TGF-&szlig; family of signaling molecules and some family members make fundamental contributions to early vertebrate development as well. The dpp protein is secreted and binds to cell surface receptors on target cells. The dpp signal is necessary for determination of the dorsal ectoderm in the early embryo, for morphogenesis of the gut, for growth in the proximal to distal axis of the adult appendages, for proper oogenesis and patterning of the eggshell, and numerous other developmental events.</p>\r\n        <p>Our current focus is on elucidating the cellular and developmental pathways by which the dpp signal acts. We are using a combination of genetic analyses and molecular approaches to address these topics, in particular, focusing on the identification and characterization of genes that encode products which interact with the dpp protein. (1) At the cellular level, we wish to understand the nature of the signal transduction cascade that is activated in cells in which the dpp receptor protein is activated. We now know that dpp receptors are complexes of transmembrane proteins that have extracellular domains that bind dpp protein and intracellular domains that act as serine-threonine protein kinases. Presumably, these kinases act to phosphorylate target proteins in the cell and trigger several sequential signaling steps until finally, the activities of transcription factors in the nuclei of these cells are altered. However, the identities of the proteins involved in this process are known. (2) At the developmental level, we want to understand the role that dpp contributes to pattern formation and how this role is coordinated with other aspects of these pattern formation events. In these processes, we are particularly interested in the processes underlying appendage development, dorsal-ventral patterning of the embryo and eggshell development during oogenesis.</p>\r\n        <p>Research topics in the laboratory are numerous, and can range from genetic to embryological to molecular studies or a mix of several of these approaches.</p>",

Specifically, we are investigating the molecular mechanisms underlying the ability of cells to discriminate self from non-self in the uropathogen <i>Proteus mirabilis</i>.  The Gram-negative bacterium <i>P. mirabilis</i> is an opportunistic pathogen that causes urinary tract infections, most significantly in patients with long-term indwelling catheters.  <i>P. mirabilis</i> populations can form crystalline biofilms and can cause the formation of kidney stones in patients.  <i>P. mirabilis</i> populations display a remarkable phenomenon when migrating as a swarm across a surface: a visible boundary forms between swarms of different <i>P. mirabilis strains</i>.  In contrast, swarms of the same strain do not give rise to a visible boundary and merge, indicating that <i>P. mirabilis</i> swarms are capable of territoriality and of self versus non-self recognition.</p>\r\n \r\n<p>This self vs non-self recognition behavior in <i>P. mirabilis</i> is similar to allorecognition in eukaryotic cells and is analogous to territoriality in larger organisms.  Conspecific self vs non-self recognition is widely found throughout biology, including <i>E. coli</i>, <i>Plasmodium</i>, plant roots, marine chordates, and vertebrate immune systems. Connecting these is a fundamental question: how does a cell recognize and differentiate self from non-self?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recently we have identified a genetic locus in <i>P. mirabilis</i> that encodes components necessary for self vs non-self recognition and for the definition of strain-specific identity. We utilize approaches to microbiology, cell biology, molecular biology, and biochemistry to further dissect the role of these identified genes in self vs non-self recognition and moreover to understand the molecular mechanisms of social behaviors in bacteria.</p>",

It has originated and evolved independently many times in many different organisms; the different systems are thus biochemically distinct and have many diverse functions. Studies with luminous bacteria led to the discovery of <i>autoinduction</i>, now referred to as <i>quorum sensing</i>. Studies with coelenterate bioluminescence led to the first discovery of an accessory emitter in bioluminescence, green fluoresent protein (GFP). Research in my laboratory is now concerned with the structure, organization and regulation of genes associated with both dipteran and dinoflagellate luminescence systems, as well as the structures of the luciferins and luciferases.\r\n<strong>CIRCADIAN</strong> (daily) <strong>CONTROL</strong> represents a very fundamental yet still very poorly understood feature of higher organisms. Jet lag is a symptom of the disruption of our circadian system. Most organisms--as well as individual eukaryotic cells and some bacteria--possess a temporal control mechanism over many biochemical and physiological processes. Our research is concerned with the basic molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for these rhythms in the unicellular bioluminescent dinoflagellate <i>Gonyaulax polyedra</i>, where we have shown that the rhythm of bioluminescence involves a daily synthesis and destruction of proteins, and that inhibitors of protein synthesis can reset the phase. While the amounts of these proteins increase and decrease by a factor of 10 on a daily basis, the mRNAs for these proteins remain at the same level day and night. Synthesis is thus controlled at the translational level, a feature so far unique to this system.",

By manipulating inhibitory transmission in the neocortex, amblyopic effects of deprivation are delayed (by gene-targeted reduction of GABA synthesis) or accelerated (by cortical infusion of a positive GABA receptor modulator, diazepam).</p>\r\n        A major goal now is to establish the generality of this principle of excitatory-inhibitory balance across brain regions and systems. Remarkably, a specific, local inhibitory circuit may drive critical period onset in visual cortex. Downstream of this trigger lies an extracellular proteolytic cascade and structural reorganizations, which ultimately consolidate plasticity. Imaging efforts at the Center for Brain Science will visualize the dynamic re-wiring of connections in mouse models to provide further insight for translational research into disorders of critical period development at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston.",

Thus, much of our research focuses on identifying and characterizing the molecular changes responsible for traits that affect fitness of organisms in the wild. To this end, we use an interdisciplinary approach combining molecular techniques (ranging from next-gen sequencing and transcriptomics to cell-based pharmacological assays and in vivo viral vectors), population-genetic tests, classical genetic crosses, lab-based behavioral assays and field-based experiments. We focus primarily on natural populations of mammals in which ecological, developmental and genomic information can be combined to address questions about the evolution of morphological, behavioral and reproductive diversity.",

This linkage mobilizes dsRNA-silencing signals and enables silencing to spread from the site of initiation throughout the animal and to the progeny. This phenomenon, known as systemic RNAi, is a conserved process among many multicellular organisms. Through genetic analysis, we have isolated systemic RNAi defective mutants (sid) and have identified the corresponding proteins (SID). SID-1 is a widely conserved dsRNA channel that selectively and specifically transports dsRNA into cells and is essential for systemic RNAi. A mammalian SID-1 homolog has been implicated in cytoplasmic delivery of modified siRNAs, suggesting that dsRNA transport is a conserved function for this family of channel proteins. SID-2 is a putative dsRNA receptor that is expressed and localized exclusively to the luminal membrane of the intestine. SID-2 transports ingested dsRNA across the intestinal epithelium into the animal to trigger RNAi. This process of sequence-specific gene silencing in response to environmentally-encountered dsRNA, known as environmental RNAi, is widespread throughout nature, including in mammals.  The long-term objective of our research is to understand the physiological importance and mechanism of intercellular RNA transport in animals. \r\n </p>",

The bacterial transposon Tn10 moves by a series of specific DNA breaking and joining events which require a Tn10-encoded transposase protein and accessory host proteins, IHF and HU. We wish to understand the precise nature andorder of reaction steps, the types of DNA/protein complexes involved, the way in which the transposon ends find one another, the mechanistic role of host factors, the importance of DNA topology, and the functional organization of transposase protein.</p>\r        <p>2. Meiosis in S. cerevisiae. During meiosis, homologous chromosomes recognize one another (&quot;pair&quot;) and engage in recombination prior to, and as a prerequisite for, their segregation at the first meiotic division.

My laboratory conducts research in a number of areas that fall within the broad confines of this topic, using the fruitfly <i>Drosophila melanogaster </i>as a system of choice.&nbsp; <i>Drosophila </i>offers a unique opportunity to conduct investigations at the interface between development and behavior, to examine how behavior is modulated by the nervous system's functional plasticity, and to illuminate the relationship between genetic control and the evolutionary divergence of behavior.</p>\r\n        Current research in the laboratory includes a study of how a signaling protein, Hedgehog, is transported along axons of the developing visual system, a means by which the retina controls the number of target neurons for retinal axons in the brain. We study the converse problem of how contact between photoreceptor axons and their targets in the brain influences the final stages of photoreceptor neuronal differentiation, including the development of synapses.&nbsp; With respect to the function and plasticity of the adult visual system, one investigation in the lab asks how visual experience is remembered, particularly with regard to the wavelength of light, as flies make directional choices in a walking maze. The aim of this project is to determine where and how such memories are encoded. Another study looks at how a protein involved in synaptic plasticity is synthesized locally in response to environmental inputs that produce a memory. A long-term goal of our work is to identify genetic differences that underlie behavioral changes associated with speciation, and relate these to developmental and functional differences in the nervous system.",

            "research_description": "<p><strong>Structural biology of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling</strong> </p>\r\n        <p>The extreme degree of compaction of DNA into chromatin would seem to create an insurmountable barrier to all DNA transactions. However, a variety of mechanisms have evolved that allow cells to turn this apparent impediment into a highly dynamic and finely tuned regulatory device that controls the accessibility of specific DNA sequences. A multitude of players are involved in achieving this regulation. A number of protein factors are involved in covalently modifying chromatin&mdash;either DNA itself or the histone octamer around which DNA is wrapped. Another group, the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes, utilizes the energy from ATP hydrolysis to non-covalently modify nucleosomes. These remodelers are large (often above 1 MDa) multi-subunit complexes that are conserved from yeast to humans and their activity leads to a number of different fates for the remodeled nucleosomes: sliding along DNA, transfer to a different DNA segment, formation of a &ldquo;loose&rdquo; nucleosome structure and exchange of histone components. Despite a significant body of work describing these outcomes we do not yet understand mechanistically how ATP-dependent chromatin remodelers actually remodel chromatin.</p>\r\n        <p>Our group is approaching this question from a structural point of view. We use primarily three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D EM) to study the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex RSC (<u>R</u>emodels the <u>S</u>tructure of <u>C</u>hromatin) from <em>S.cerevisiae. </em>This complex has been extensively characterized biochemically and genetically, making it an ideal model system. Electron microscopy is a powerful structural technique to study large macromolecular assemblies that are not amenable to more traditional methods either due to their low abundance (when purified from natural sources, for example) or refractory to crystallization (due to their intrinsic flexibility). More importantly, electron microscopy of vitrified samples (cryo-EM) holds the promise of allowing us to image&mdash;at high resolution and under physiological conditions&mdash;the conformational diversity present in and potentially central to the function of many macromolecular assemblies.</p>\r\n        <p>The long-term goal of our research is to visualize the entire remodeling mechanism at high resolution in order to understand its chemical underpinnings. In the meantime, we are starting to dissect RSC at lower resolution. We have obtained an initial reconstruction of the complex and are in the process of obtaining one of RSC bound to its substrate, the nucleosome. At the same time, we will build a map of the positions of a number of the 15 different subunits that comprise RSC by tagging them and probing their location; this will help us better understand their biological role within the complex. The group is also interested in what remains one of the major challenges in 3D EM&mdash;obtaining initial models of novel samples. We recently developed a new reconstruction method (Orthogonal Tilt Reconstruction) that addresses some of the problems and limitations of existing approaches. We are interested in further developing this method and eventually automating it to make the generation of initial models a robust and routine aspect of 3D EM.</p>",

            "research_description": "<p>To build organs, embryos have evolved mechanisms that integrate the development of complex populations of cells. Our group studies organ formation using a simple organ, the <i>C. elegans </i>pharynx (or foregut), that nonetheless faces the same hurdles that confront organs in more complicated animals. We combine molecular genetics, genomics and cell biological approaches to address four aspects of organogenesis:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Pluripotency and cell-fate acquisition:</strong></p>\r\n<p>Early embryonic cells are born pluripotent, but over time their developmental choices become restricted. We study the processes that mediate the transition from pluripotency to cell-fate acquisition, with a particular focus on the interplay between sequence-specific transcription factors, chromatin organization and nuclear architecture (Yuzyuk 2009, Kiefer 2007). </p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Transcriptional logic of organogenesis:</strong></p>\r\n<p> Our previous studies revealed that there are \u2018organ selector genes\u2019 that encode transcription factors and specify organ identity. We would like to understand how the pharynx selector gene <i>pha-4</i> coordinates organ formation in space and time. We are particularly interested in the role of DNA binding affinity for temporal control and promoter priming (Gaudet 2002, 2004, Deplancke 2006, Updike 2006).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nutrition and post-embryonic development.</strong></p>\r\n<p> Despite its simple organization, the nematode digestive tract is highly responsive to nutrient availability. Worms can adjust their rate of feeding, their energy utilization and, most dramatically, their development and growth. Our goal is to probe how the developmental pathways that govern gut development in embryos are redeployed after birth, to sense and respond to food. (Ao 2006, Sheaffer 2008).</p>\r\n\t\r\n<p><strong>Epithelial tubes:</strong></p>\r\n<p> Many organs, including the <i>C. elegans</i> pharynx, are systems of epithelial tubes that provide an essential function by transporting gases or liquids. Epithelial tubes can be formed by remodeling pre-existing sheets of epithelial cells or by constructing tubular epithelia <i>de novo</i>. Nephrons in the kidney are one example of <i>de novo</i> epithelialization, the <i>C. elegans</i> pharynx is another. While significant progress has been made towards understanding the mechanisms that govern folding of epithelial sheets, very little is known about tubulogenesis by <i>de novo</i> epithelialization. In <i>C. elegans</i>, the pharynx tube is formed in the absence of known epithelial regulators such as cadherins, integrins or catenins. A new direction for the lab is to elucidate cadherin-independent epithelial tube formation.</p>",

Our studies combine different aspects of cell cycle checkpoint control, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair in order to understand how these pathways are integrated so that the complicated task of genome duplication during S phase is performed in an error-free manner. Currently, there are four major areas of interests:</p>\r\n        <p><b>1. Checkpoint-independent control of the cell cycle</b></p>\r\n        <p>The last fifteen years have seen enormous progress in the understanding of how DNA damage and replication checkpoint pathways regulate the cell cycle. By contrast, very little is known about checkpoint-independent mechanisms for responding to DNA damage. Work from our laboratory has recently identified a novel damage response pathway that senses the presence of single-strand breaks in DNA and responds through an arrest to further DNA replication. This pathway does not share components with the canonical checkpoint pathway, and thus represents a novel DNA damage response mechanism. We are currently using biochemical purification from frog egg extracts to identify and study the components of this new pathway. </p>\r\n        <p><b>2. Maintenance of stalled replication forks</b></p>\r\n        <p>A critical task of the DNA damage checkpoint is to maintain the stability of replication complexes that stall upon exposure to damaged DNA, so that replication may resume after the damage has been repaired or bypassed. We are currently performing genetic screens in <i>C. elegans </i>to identify factors that ensure replication fork stability during the DNA damage response. </p>\r\n        <p><b>3. Regulation of the initiation of DNA replication</b></p>\r\n        <p>The initiation of DNA replication is tightly regulated, and this regulation is critical for prevention of genome instability. We have identified a protein, Mus101, which is required for replication initiation and also functions in the DNA damage response. We are currently exploring the mechanism of action of Mus101 in replication, using frog egg extracts. &nbsp; We have found that Mus101 is a component of the pre-replication complex, and that it is recruited to origins of replication through a novel protein activity. &nbsp; We have established a simple assay for Mus101 loading onto origins of replication, and we are now isolating the loading activity using biochemical purification.</p>\r\n        <p><b>4. The role of mutagenic polymerases in generating genotypic variation in response to environmental cues </b></p>\r\n        <p>We are interested in the possibility that so-called &quot;trans-lesion&quot; polymerases have evolved for two distinct purposes, DNA repair and the ability to rapidly generate genotypic complexity within a population experiencing environmental stress. &nbsp; We are performing directed evolution experiments in <i>C. elegans </i>to ask if modulating the expression of these polymerases affects the ability of the organism to adapt to changes in the environment.</p>",

This question has fascinated biologists for over a century and is directly relevant to cancer and other important medical problems. We study two aspects of chromosome behavior: how chromosomes attach to the chromosome segregation machinery (the spindle) in mitosis and meiosis, and the spindle checkpoint, the control circuit that cells use to make sure that their chromosomes are properly lined up on the mitotic spindle before initiating chromosome segregation. </p>\r\n        <p>Budding yeast has two mating types and can exist stably as both haploids and diploids.&nbsp; We use microfluidics, video microscopy, and genetic manipulation to ask how cells pick a single axis of polarization when they are exposed to mating pheromones, how this axis is aligned to pheromone gradients, and how pairs of cells efficiently court and then fuse with each other in dense mixtures of mating cells.&nbsp; Our results suggest that cells use the cytoskeleton to integrate signaling from all parts of the cell surface in way that guarantees a single axis of polarity.</p>\r\n        <p>How does selective pressure induce the evolution of new traits and how predictable is the outcome of such experiments? We study both general and specific questions.&nbsp; The general questions include attempting to use theory and experiment to determine how the rate of evolution depends on population sizes and the beneficial mutation rate, evolving altered mating preferences (a first step towards speciation), investigating the advantages of mutators, evolving cooperation, and determining the distribution of beneficial and deleterious mutations.&nbsp; The more specific projects use the mating pathway and attempt to create connections to other signaling pathways and turn the pathway from a rapidly reversible and graded response into a stable switch that can be thrown by a single exposure to mating pheromone.</p>",

Early work explored population dynamics in the presence of varying growth rates and convection, leading to universal predictions for the spreading and transverse profile of populations in space- and time-dependent environments. Together with his student, David Lubensky, Nelson developed a theory of force-induced denaturation of double-stranded DNA. Sequence heterogeneity dominates the dynamics of the un-zipping fork (with possible implications for DNA replication in prokaryotes) over a large of forces above an unzipping transition. Energy barriers near the transition scale as the square root of the genome size. Recent observations of jumps and plateaus in the unzipping of lambda phage DNA at constant force (the result of a collaboration with his colleague, Mara Prentiss) are consistent with these predictions. Sequence heterogeneity was also predicted to have a re-markable effect on the dynamics of motor proteins such as helicases, exonulceases and RNA polymerases, leading to sublinear drift in time of these complex enzymes and a possible expla-nation for the nearly horizontal velocity-force curves observed near the stall force in experi-ments on RNA polymerase. Nelson and colleagues have also studied the shapes of viruses, showing that the icosahedral packing of protein capsomeres of spherical viruses becomes un-stable to faceting for sufficiently large virus size. A parametization of the architecture of virus shells in terms of single dimensionless &quot;von Karman number&quot; shows why small viruses are round and large ones are faceted, and allows important information about the elastic constants to be extracted from electron micrographs.</p>",

            "research_description": "<p><span class=\"Medium\">Summary</span></p>\r\n<p> Erin O'Shea studies how cells monitor the environment and regulate gene expression, work that has implications for understanding cancer and other diseases. She is also interested in deciphering the logic of signaling and transcriptional control, and in understanding the function and mechanism of oscillation of a three-protein circadian clock.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"Medium\">The Phosphate-Responsive Signaling Pathway</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>A novel mechanism of metabolite-dependent kinase regulation.</b></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Signaling pathways play crucial roles in the ability of cells to sense and respond to changes in the availability of essential nutrients. We have used the phosphate-responsive signaling pathway in budding yeast as a model system with which to investigate basic mechanisms of signal transduction and the regulation of transcription factor activity. A central player in this pathway is the cyclin\u2013cyclin-dependent protein kinase (CDK) Pho80-Pho85, whose function is to phosphorylate and regulate the activity of the transcription factor Pho4, controlling expression of phosphate-responsive genes. The activity of Pho80-Pho85 is regulated in response to nutrient availability by the CDK inhibitor Pho81. In collaboration with John York's lab (HHMI, Duke University), we discovered that inhibition of Pho80-Pho85 by Pho81 requires an evolutionarily conserved secondary metabolite, the inositol pyrophosphate IP7. Levels of this metabolite are regulated in response to phosphate availability. Our current work is focused on identifying the mechanism underlying phosphate-dependent changes in inositol pyrophospate levels and defining the mechanism of inhibition of Pho80-Pho85 by Pho81 and IP7.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Sensing nutrient availability.</b></p>\r\n<p>Although we know much about the function and regulation of the phosphate-responsive signaling pathway downstream of the kinase Pho80-Pho85, we know less about how phosphate is sensed by cells and how changes in phosphate levels lead to changes in the kinase activity of Pho80-Pho85. To identify proteins that function upstream of this kinase we are performing a genome-wide screen to identify genes whose products are involved in phosphate sensing. This screen may reveal new connections between phosphate metabolism and other nutrient-sensing and metabolic pathways.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"Medium\">The Logic and Evolution of Transcriptional Control</span></p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p><b>Signal processing by promoters. </b></p>\r\n<p>We seek to understand how regulatory regions of genes transform information about transcription factor input into quantitative gene expression output. Our goal is to develop a quantitative model that describes how promoter sequence influences the threshold for gene activation, maximum transcriptional output, and the sensitivity of the response. To achieve this goal, we are using model promoters to analyze the relationship between transcription factor input and gene expression output in single cells. We quantify the input-output relationship in the wild-type promoter and in variants in which key features of promoter sequence have been altered, and we use these data to inform mechanistic models.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Encoding and decoding information in transcription factor dynamics. </b></p>\r\n<p>Many transcription factors undergo dynamic changes in subcellular localization in response to alterations in signaling. We are interested in whether different patterns of transcription factor dynamics are generated in response to different environmental changes, and whether different dynamic patterns produce distinct patterns of gene expression. To investigate these issues we are using microarrays and single-cell experiments to study the budding yeast transcription factor Msn2, which is activated in response to numerous stress conditions and controls expression of ~100 genes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Transcriptional regulatory network evolution. </b></p>\r\n<p>In collaboration with Aviv Regev (Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Broad Institute), we are using the evolutionarily conserved HOG MAPK pathway and phosphate-responsive signaling pathways as models to investigate the evolution of transcriptional regulatory networks. This work is enabled by the genome sequences of a number of yeast species, by an orthology map generated in the Regev lab, and also by our development of methodology to construct quantitative maps of transcriptional networks from microarray data. We are combining experiments and computational approaches to characterize how these networks have evolved fromSchizosaccharomyces pombe to S. cerevisiae and then explain the mechanisms allowing these regulatory changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span class=\"Medium\">The Cyanobacterial Circadian Clock</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>Uncovering the mechanism of timekeeping.</b></p>\r\n<p>rganisms exhibit oscillations in metabolism and behavior that are coordinated with the environmental light-dark cycle. Circadian rhythms are present even in single-celled cyanobacteria, which use these oscillations to alternate photosynthesis with nitrogen fixation, two mutually exclusive biochemical processes. It is thought that circadian rhythms rely on an autoregulatory transcription and translation feedback cycle to generate oscillations. In the cyanobacterial circadian oscillator, genetic and biochemical studies have revealed that three proteins (KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC) make up the timekeeping mechanism and that KaiC undergoes changes in phosphorylation state with periodicity that corresponds to the circadian cycle. Remarkably, Takao Kondo's group (Nagoya University, Japan) has demonstrated that these three proteins (plus ATP) are sufficient to produce sustained oscillations in the phosphorylation state of KaiC in vitro\u2014thus, the oscillator in cyanobacteria is post-translational. We have collaborated with Daniel Fisher (Stanford University) to combine experiments with modeling to uncover the basis of sustained oscillations. We are now interested in understanding other remarkable properties of this clock\u2014the relative insensitivity of its period to changes in protein concentrations and temperature\u2014which are observed in vivo and in vitro.</p>\r\n<p><b>Studies of clock input.</b></p>\r\n<p>Circadian clocks receive environmental input, which allows them to adjust the phase of their internal oscillator to match cycles in the environment. We are developing a mechanistic understanding of how changes in light availability and temperature can shift the phase of the oscillator. These studies build on pioneering genetic work of Kondo and Susan Golden (University of California, San Diego), who have identified proteins involved in interactions with the core oscillator. Our recent work explores the influence of metabolism on the phase shift.</p>\r\n<p><b>Studies of clock output.</b></p>\r\n<p>The cyanobacterial circadian clock coordinates cell physiology with the environmental light-day cycle, in part by controlling gene expression. Genetic studies have identified several proteins that are required for circadian gene expression. Additionally, it has been shown that the state of supercoiling of endogenous plasmids and the state of chromosome compaction vary with circadian time. Our recent work has shown that changes in supercoiling correlate with circadian gene expression and that perturbation of supercoiling can elicit gene expression changes similar to those in the circadian cycle. We are now focused on determining how the core oscillator controls supercoiling and on defining what determines how promoters respond to changes in superhelical status. We are also investigating the role of proteins required to generate circadian oscillations in gene expression.</p>",

Vertebrate embryogenesis</b></p>\r\n<p>The vertebrate body plan is set up during gastrulation, when a ball of undifferentiated, totipotent cells is transformed into an embryo. This process results in the formation of the three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) and the three axes (anterior-posterior, dorsal-ventral and left-right). We wish to understand how signaling pathways, transcription factors, chromatin modifications and non-coding RNAs regulate this process. We are using genetic, biophysical and in vivo imaging approaches to determine how signals move through fields of cells and elicit concentration dependent effects. In parallel, we use biochemical and genetic approaches to determine how chromatin modifications and non-coding RNAs regulate early development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>2. Sensory neuron development and function</b></p>\r\n<p>Animals protect themselves by sensing potentially harmful thermal, mechanical or chemical stimuli. This process of nociception is mediated by specific sensory receptors and circuits. We analyze the development and function of trigeminal sensory neurons, the primary nociceptors in the vertebrate head. We are using genetic and imaging approaches to study the molecules that regulate neuronal interactions and morphologies. In addition, we have begun to use in vivo imaging approaches and serial EM reconstruction to determine how different stimuli are encoded in the trigeminal ganglion and hindbrain. </p>\r\n\r\n<p><b>3. Sleep and wakefulness</b></p>\r\n<p>The genetic and cellular mechanisms that control sleep and wake states remain largely elusive. We have established zebrafish as a model system for sleep research. Zebrafish have the basic hallmarks of sleep-like behaviors. Sleeping fish require stronger stimuli than awake fish to initiate movement and sleep deprivation is followed by increased sleep. In addition, the zebrafish brain expresses peptides that have been implicated in human sleep disorders. We are using genetic and pharmacological screens to isolate sleep regulators and use electrophysiological and imaging approaches to dissect sleep circuits. </p>",

The normal human response to bacterial and viral infection involves these molecules and results in either the generation of T helper cells and antibodies or of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes. In addition, many important human autoimmune diseases are linked to particular alleles of the class I and class II proteins. Recently, the importance of still another immune recognition system mediated by Natural Killer (NK) cells has become apparent. </p>\r\n        <p>My laboratory is focused now on 3 main projects: </p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n          <li>The role of MHC proteins and of products of other disease susceptibility genes in human autoimmunity, including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, pemphigus vulgaris and ankylosing spondylitis;<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>Activating and inhibitory immunological synapses in human natural killer cells: how they are formed and how they function, particularly in relation to lipid rafts;<br>\r\n              <br>\r\n          </li>\r\n          <li>Uterine decidual lymphocytes and their roles in the immunobiology of pregnancy.

            "research_description": "<p>The ability of efficiently acquiring sensory information and selecting an appropriate action is the essence of flexible behaviors. To make good decisions, it is also crucial to evaluate the consequences of previous actions (gains and costs) and adjust strategies for future decisions. Our laboratory is interested in neuronal processes by which sensory information and memory about previous experiences guide behavior of the animal. Our main questions are:</p>\r\n        <ol>\r\n          <li>How is odor information coded and processed by an ensemble of neurons?</li>\r\n          <li>What kinds of circuit dynamics underlie decision-making processes?</li>\r\n          <li>What are the mechanisms for learning based on rewards and punishments?</li>\r\n        </ol>        <p>We have developed an odor-guided perceptual decision task in rats and mice. This behavioral paradigm was recently combined with a multi-electrode recording technique (tetrodes) which allows us to monitor activity of multiple neurons simultaneously while animals are performing a behavioral task. Particular emphasis will be made on the use of behavior. First, behavioral paradigms specify computations (e.g. extracting relevant information in the sensory stimulus) and behavioral goals (e.g. maximizing rewards in a certain period) to be achieved. This in turn guides the way neuronal activities are analyzed. Furthermore, behavioral experiments are necessary to test relevance of certain activity of neurons or hypothesis about &quot;neural codes&quot; obtained in neuronal recordings. We will use various molecular and genetic tools available in mice to further test specific hypotheses experimentally. By combining the above approaches, we wish to establish a causal link between activity of specific neuronal circuits and the dynamics of behavior and learning.</p>",

His studies have elucidated the molecular mechanisms by which DNA-modifying proteins \r\n- especially DNA methyltransferases and DNA repair proteins - recognize and process their substrates.  Verdine is the \r\nco-discoverer of a key pathway for the repair of oxidatively damaged DNA in higher organisms, including man.  His efforts \r\nin the area of transcriptional regulation have resulted in the structural characterization of NF-kB (with S. C. Harrison) and \r\nthe isolation and structural elucidation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (with A. Rao and G. Wagner, respectively).  \r\nRecently, he solved a long-standing problem in transcriptional regulation by showing that acidic activation domains undergo \r\ninduced a-helix formation upon binding to a target TAF protein.  He is the first to show that a completely non-natural \r\nmolecule can co-activate transcription in cells, thus paving the way for the discovery of small molecules that can directly \r\nactivate the expression of specific genes.

When two shmoos reach one another, the two cells fuse and produce a diploid cell. Here a MATa cell was exposed to a spatial gradient of alpha factor (imaged in red), the pheromone normally emitted by the MATalpha cells. This artificial gradient was produced using synthesized alpha factor flown in a \"\"two phases laminar flow chamber\"\", the MATa cells being attached on a coverslip closing the chamber. In green is shown the localization of the MAP kinase Fus3, specific for the pheromone response pathway, coupled to a yellow fluorescent protein, YFP. This MAP kinase is usually concentrated only in the nucleus and relocates at the tip of the mating projection when cells polarize and grow in the direction of a pheromone gradient.\"",

Because they respond robustly to natural jitter (white waveform), they silence motion sensitive ganglion cells whenever the motion signal is the same across the retina. \r\n\r\n<p>When an object in the world moves, the motion signal in some ganglion cells will differ from that of the polyaxonal amacrine cells and hence we perceive motion.</p>",

These sperm groups swim faster than individual sperm and thus have an advantage in the race to fertilize the female ova.  Using fluorescent labeling, it has been possible to show that sperm from two different males (one labeled red, and one green) preferentially cooperate with related sperm -- these mice can even discriminate against sperm from a full-sib littermate, which suggests a highly-refined (and yet undescribed) recognition mechanism at the level of sperm cells. This discriminatory behavior does not occur in a closely-related monogamous species, suggesting this complex behavior is driven by sexual selection.",

This core oscillator can be reconstituted in a test tube using three recombinantly expressed proteins: KaiA, KaiB and KaiC.  KaiC is an autokinase and autophosphatase that can be phosphorylated at two adjacent residues: S431 and T432.  To study the role of multisite phosphorylation in this oscillator system, the abundance of each possible phosphorylated form of KaiC was quantified using mass spectrometry with isotopically labeled peptide standards during a 24 cycle of the oscillator.  The plot shows the modification state of the pool of KaiC molecules in an oscillating reaction during three full cycles: KaiC phosphorylated only on T432 (green curve), KaiC phosphorylated only on S431 (red curve), KaiC phosphorylated on both sites (blue curve), and the total fraction of phosphorylated KaiC (black curve).  Each form of KaiC peaks at a distinct phase of the reaction, indicating that circadian time is encoded by the phosphorylation state of KaiC.",

This image shows a ventral view of a living transgenic zebrafish at 4 days of age with the rod photoreceptors expressing the GFP transgene (cells in green).
