Personnel Directory 
==========

This repository contains the data models for a basic personnel directory tailored for the needs of single academic department.

The type of "shadow" directory was created to meet the need of tracking people with cross affiliations or functional affiliations not captured by the university's central repository.

Much of the code is "old" in that it was used to connect with intranets and other systems that have since been taken offline.

Of note, is the hu_ldap directory.  It was used to track whether or not a person may be listed in an online directory per university policy.  

Apologies for the brief notes--these have been tacked on nearly 4 years after the original project.
